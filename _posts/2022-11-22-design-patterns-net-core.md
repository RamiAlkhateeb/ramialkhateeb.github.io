Imagine you have a journal of your most intimate thoughts
<br>
Now, you could add functionality for adding an entry to the journal
<br>
Now, suppose you decide to make the journal persist by saving it to a file. You add 
this code to the Journal class, We therefore state that persistence is a separate concern,
<br>
And this is precisely what we mean by Single Responsibility: each class has only one 
responsibility and therefore has only one reason to change. Journal would need to 
change only if thereâ€™s something more that needs to be done with respect to in-memory 
storage of entries; for example, you might want each entry prefixed by a timestamp, so 
you would change the Add() method to do exactly that. On the other hand, if you wanted 
to change the persistence mechanic, this would be changed in PersistenceManager.

#### Open-Closed Principle
Suppose we have an (entirely hypothetical) range of products in a database. Each 
product has a color and size
<br>
Now, we want to provide certain filtering capabilities for a given set of products. 
We make a ProductFilter service class. To support filtering products by color, we 
implement it as follows
