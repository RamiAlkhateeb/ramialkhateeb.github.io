# A review of paper "Bitcoin investment: a mixed methods study of investment motivations"

#### Introduction
It is estimated that around 25 million individuals worldwide possess bitcoin1 which has a market capitalisation of around 186 USD billion.2 Those millions 
of users mostly see their bitcoin engagement as an investment (Lielacher, 2019) and a variety of stakeholders stand to benefit by better understanding what 
motivates people to invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin companies such as wallet providers or crypto exchanges need 
to understand why individuals invest in bitcoin in order to optimise their marketing and public relations 
activities in an effort, among others, to establish bitcoin as a widely accepted medium of exchange and an 
accepted cryptocurrency (Mattke et al., 2020). 
Investorsâ€™ understanding of the dynamics of bitcoin prices rests upon their understanding of underlying investment reasons. Organisations aiming to finance new ventures by launching their own cryptocurrency, e.g., through initial coin offering (ICO) or security 
token offering (STO) (Fisch, 2019), need to understand why individuals invest in cryptocurrency in order to draw conclusions for the design of their own coins or tokens. In summary, developing a better understanding of what drives investing in bitcoin is relevant for a variety of stakeholders in 
research and practise.
While there are various theories to explain why individuals invest (e.g., prospect theory or rational choice theory), we rely on regret theory (Loomes & 
Sugden, 1982) as one of the most used theoretical lenses in investment research. It has been used to understand portfolio investment (Solnik & Zuo, 2012), currency hedging (Michenaud & Solnik, 2008) and IT investment (Lankton & Luft, 2008; EH Park et al., 2016)
